# High-Accuracy Custom Object Detection Roadmap

## Phase 1: Setup & Data Preparation

### 1.1 Environment Setup

- [x] Set up Python environment with PyTorch and YOLOv8
- [x] Configure GPU support (CUDA) for faster training
- [ ] Set up experiment tracking (Weights & Biases)

### 1.2 Dataset Collection & Annotation

- [ ] Identify target object categories
- [ ] Source high-quality images (minimum 1,000 images per class)
- [ ] Annotate images with bounding boxes (using Roboflow/LabelImg)
- [ ] Split data into train/validation/test sets (70/15/15)

## Phase 2: Model Development

### 2.1 Baseline Model

- [ ] Train YOLOv8x (largest model) as baseline
- [ ] Implement data augmentation (Mosaic, MixUp, etc.)
- [ ] Set up learning rate finder

### 2.2 Model Optimization

- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- [ ] Test different YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLO-NAS)
- [ ] Implement test-time augmentation (TTA)

## Phase 3: Performance Improvement

### 3.1 Data-Centric Improvements

- [ ] Analyze model errors and collect more data for hard cases
- [ ] Implement class balancing (if needed)
- [ ] Add synthetic data (if applicable)

### 3.2 Architecture Tweaks

- [ ] Modify anchor boxes for custom objects
- [ ] Implement attention mechanisms
- [ ] Try different backbones (e.g., EfficientNet, CSPDarknet)

## Phase 4: Evaluation & Deployment

### 4.1 Rigorous Testing

- [ ] Evaluate on diverse test sets
- [ ] Test in different lighting/weather conditions
- [ ] Benchmark against other models (Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet)

### 4.2 Optimization for Deployment

- [ ] Convert to ONNX/TensorRT for faster inference
- [ ] Implement model quantization
- [ ] Create simple inference script with confidence thresholds

## Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- Albumentations (for advanced augmentations)
- Weights & Biases (for experiment tracking)

## Performance Metrics

- mAP@0.5 (primary metric)
- mAP@0.5:0.95
- Precision/Recall
- FPS (on target hardware)

## Best Practices

- Use version control for all code and configs
- Document all experiments and results
- Maintain reproducible environment (Docker/Poetry)
- Regular model evaluation on validation set

## Next Steps After MVP

1. Deploy as REST API
2. Build simple web interface
3. Implement batch processing
4. Add support for video streams
